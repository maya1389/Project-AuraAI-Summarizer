The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program."", ""Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite. Mice training included the co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity."", ""Russian biomedical research in space traditionally has employed dogs, rats, monkeys, and more recently Mongolian gerbils. Unlike more recent space experiments that used female mice, males were flown in the Bion-M 1 mission. Bion missions have contributed comprehensive data on adaptive responses of sensorimotor, cardiovascular, muscle, bone and other systems."", ""The mouse has become the most prevalent “mammalian model” in biomedical research. While mice are preferred mammalian models for molecular biology studies, their small size is a debated limitation rather than an advantage for physiological studies. The use of genetically controlled mice offers a means to reduce inter-individual variability and obtain potentially more consistent results."", ""Half of the mice died during the course of this mission due to various estimated reasons. To our knowledge, Bion-M 1 is the first study with mice to follow the dynamics of re-adaptation to normal gravity or to assess post-flight in vitro functions. The in vivo measurements in-flight included video recording of mice behavior and continuous recording of arterial pressure during all stages of the flight."", ""The set of in vivo measurements was designed to provide data on the effects of microgravity on the physiological systems of interest. To reduce the possibility of inadvertently stressing the mice with numerous post-flight tests, the decision was made to monitor mice in their home cage using an automated data collection system. The program had to be performed with a limited number of animals; thus the use of a repeated measures design."", ""These samples were analyzed using morphological (light and electron microscopy, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry), biochemical and a variety of molecular-biology techniques. Functional properties of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and resistive arteries samples were evaluated using myography and atomic force microscopy. Mice for in vitro studies were euthanized by cervical dislocation."", ""It was decided that the optimal age of mice at launch was 4–5 months, when the males were still young but fully mature. Space environment affects microorganisms by increasing their virulence. It is reasonable to think that even pseudo pathogenic species may increase morbidity during prolonged exposure in space. These considerations underscored the necessity for the use of specific pathogen-free mice."", ""A total of 4 experimental groups were used for the flight and ground control experiments. Mice of the space flight group (SF) were exposed to microgravity for 30 days. Ground control (GC) experiment was conducted, after the landing, in the refurbished BOS flight habitats. The corresponding vivarium control ( GCV) mice were housed in the animal facility."", ""SF mice were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 satellite for 30 days. After landing mice were examined and transported to Moscow, where animals of the in vitro subgroup were dissected. Ground control experiment replicated the principal stages of the spaceflight experiment. The hardware for mice housing in-flight was an adapted version of the habitats used for rats in the original Bion program."", ""A stainless steel feeder (9 ml) was mounted at one end (the “top”) of the cylinder. The food distribution system (except for the feeders) was common to all five habitats in the block. A video camera was installed between the light bulbs; video was recorded 6 times daily (simultaneously with feeding, each session lasted 2 hours)"", ""Four groups of mice, of 3 mice each, were housed in metabolic chambers (Techniplast, Italy) and fed pelleted food (grinded) or paste food. Body weight, food and water consumption, urine volume and feces weight were monitored daily. Arterial pressure was monitored in sub-groups of mice designated for recovery, using implantable probes and telemetry hardware."", ""The body of the transmitter was implanted subcutaneously on the flank, briefly described below. Mice were anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a solution containing tiletamine/zolazepam (15 mg/kg each) combined with xylazine (3mg/kg) Depth of anesthesia was assessed regularly by hind leg pinch and observation of respiration rate."", ""The Open field test was performed in a round, 60 cm arena of black plastic with a grey floor and 40 cm high walls. Mouse behavior was video recorded at 25 fps for 10 minutes under a bright white light (200 Lux) followed by 10 min in darkness (IR light) Videos were analyzed for locomotor activity and other behavioral parameters using EthoVision v. 8.5 (Noldus) Grip force was measured using Grass FT-03 force transducer."", ""Mice were trained to direct nosepokes to the side opposite to their initial bias. The number of rewarded responses was limited to 50; each sweetened dry milk pellet weighed 14 mg. To promote learning, mice were maintained at 90% ad lib body weight. Access to food was provided throughout the day from 07:30 until 19:00–20:00."", ""Living conditions for animals considered optimal on earth cannot be provided in the confines of a space satellite. Microgravity, apart from purely technical limitations of the housing hardware, may disrupt normal mouse behavior. An inability to express natural behavior is posited as a potential cause of distress in laboratory animals. Male mice are known to have aggressive tendencies."", ""Environmental enrichment and daily handling were critically important for successful co-adaptation of mice. In a preliminary experiment, when no environmental enrichment was used, only 50% of mice (out of a sample of 42) successfully co- Adapted to living in groups of three. Shelter with good qualities is salient to mice, and male mice will compete for the resource."", ""Mice were handled daily to monitor signs of fighting and body weight. Frequent handling proved critically important to condition and calm mice to some of the tests. Extensive handling and homecage enrichments yielded male mice that were tractable and cooperative during potentially provocative procedures. Mice become extremely active when placed in a fresh cage. In unstable groups mice would fight promptly after a change of bedding."", ""When paste food was introduced, water consumption decreased roughly 5 times its original amount; body weight increased by 1.5±0.4 g, and feces weight tripled. Measured urine production in mice fed pasted food diet was 2.4 ml/10 g BW. The mice tolerated with apparent ease telemetry probe implantation. The acute recovery was complete by day 5 post-surgery."", ""Tests of corneal, pineal and other simple reflexes, performance on RotaRod, grip strength, running wheel performance, and learning and memory tests revealed no adverse effects of probe implantation. We occasionally noted, slight eyelid drooping. Although this ptosis could be interpreted as indicating compromised brain blood supply, we do not believe this was the case."", ""Mice with implanted probes can be easily group-housed with intact mice and display little (if any) differences from mice without surgery. Preliminary training and tests were performed with 42 mice for both the flight (SF) experiment and the corresponding vivarium control (SFV) 26 (62%) and 16 (53%) mice correspondingly fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The flight group of mice was transported to Cosmodrome Baikonur one week before launch."", ""The environmental parameters in the biosatellite during the orbital mission, in the climatic chamber during the ground control experiment, and in the animal facility for the VC groups were closely matched and within the acceptable range for the housing of rodents. The climate parameters aboard the satellite were within the designed range throughout the flight. In the flight (SF) experiment 16 out of 45 mice (36%) survived."", ""Video from the Bion habitats captured during both light and dark phases of each day of the mission. Video quality was superior in the early phases of the flight and visibility was compromised over time. There was no evidence of fighting, biting, or agonistic behavior in any of the video samples, so we do not believe any of deaths or injuries resulted from aggression among the males."", ""The video records clearly showed that the mice spent much time in physical contact (huddling) with one another and, significantly we think, they were grouped against the flat, feeder wall of the cylindrical habitat. We quantified their location within each habitat on select days during the flight; choosing days on which the video segments provided good available visibility."", ""Video samples documented that male mice aggregated non-randomly at the feeder wall of the cylindrical habitat. Results obtained in the Bion-M 1 mission should be taken into account in design of new mice habitats for future space missions. In microgravity, the animals assumed a greater range of orientations at the wall and may have more actively inserted their bodies into the recesses."", ""Despite the general design has long since proven its efficiency in the previous Bion flights with rats, further development is needed to better adapt it for mice based on this study. The advantage of the habitats design is its ability to support mice without any human interference in relatively long duration missions. This degree of autonomy has not been reached by any other of the existing animal habitats."", ""The majority of mice either gained some weight or maintained their pre-flight values. Post-hoc comparisons revealed no differences between the groups before the experiments. The differences in bodyweight between spaceflight, ground control and vivarium control groups were not significant. We consider that this discrepancy is explained by little opportunity for exercise in the relatively small habitats in microgravity."", ""Behavior parameters of mice from two vivarium groups, SFV and GCV, were indistinguishable. SF mice displayed reduced activity compared to any of the control groups. Mice housed in habitats (SF and GC) were reluctant to explore the center of the arena. Both SF and GC mice who were housed in relatively small habitats displayed more pronounced thigmotaxis."", ""The drastic decrease in activity by SF mice in this test is obviously related to adverse impact of prolonged 30-days spaceflight on the sensorimotor systems of these animals. Because OFT activity is known to decrease with repetitive tests, the repeated testing approach used in this study could potentially obscure the effects of spaceflight."", ""The number of control mice (GC, SFV, GCV) for in vitro studies was decreased proportionately to the number of SF animals available. Dissection of SF and SFV mice started 12 hours after landing on May 20 th , 2013. Despite significant loss of animals in flight, the scientific program was not abridged and was implemented in full."", ""The Bion-M 1 flight was unique in many ways, particularly the unprecedented duration of an automated mission with living animals. The use of male animals is obviously required for research in male reproduction and their larger size compared to females offered clear advantages. The results of our program presented here demonstrate that group housed male mice need not be excluded a priori , but quite on the contrary, can be successfully employed in space biomedical research."", ""Some of the injuries and deaths encountered in this pioneering effort suggest moving parts within the habitat present potential risks. In this space experiment we have, for the first time, introduced implantable telemetry in these small laboratory animals. The good condition of spaceflight mice was the basis for the positive results of both the recovery and tissue sharing studies."", ""The authors deeply respect the contribution to the success of this mission made by Evgeniya Yarmanova and Vyacheslav Sedletskiy.

Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170%."", ""On Earth, at 1 g, mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is an important factor in maintaining tissue health and promoting normal regenerative growth. During spaceflight, gravity-generated forces are absent and the mechanical stimulation of tissues is greatly diminished. The reduction in gravity mechano-stimulation may decrease regenerative proliferation and differentiation of tissue-specific adult stem cells. This in turn may have significant health consequences for multiple tissues throughout the body, including bone."", ""Short-duration exposure to microgravity rapidly leads to alterations in bone mineral content, cellular dynamics, and gene expression patterns. Increased osteoclast bone resorptive activity has been documented within the first several days of spaceflight. Of potentially more importance to long duration missions in microgravity is the reported reduction of bone formation by osteoblasts in growing rats. This bone formation arrest may translate into an impairment of regenerative mechanisms."", ""P53 levels are reported to increase in the muscle of hindlimb-unloaded animals. The CDKN1a/p21 knockout mouse has a viable phenotype with strong tissue regenerative abilities, such as limb re-growth. This phenotype suggests up-regulation in microgravity could explain broad regenerative deficits in space."", ""Osteocytic osteolysis was shown to be present in lactating mice but not activated in animals that were hindlimb unloaded for 4 weeks. We hypothesized that decreases in bone formation during spaceflight may be mediated by an inability of cells in osteogenic lineages to proliferate and differentiate normally."", ""The average weight loss of space-flown mice was 2.0 g, significantly lower than pre-flight values.

The shift in thickness distribution to the left in flight animals indicates an overall decrease in cross-sections throughout the ischium."", ""No difference was found in bulk density of cortical bone between the flight and ground controls. Flight samples exhibited an enlargement in lacunae of 17% in cross sectional area. We also measured canalicular diameters in a 15 µm perilacunar region and found an increase of 6% in spaceflight samples."", ""We found a 197% increase in osteoclast numbers in the bone surface of the trabecular region below the femoral head growth plate of flight samples. The bone surface covered by osteoclasts also increased by 154% in microgravity. Pyknotic nuclei were occasionally present in tissue surrounding bone, but were non-detectable in osteocytes. However, bulk density analysis showed no statistical difference between flight and ground control animals."", ""Analysis of osteoclastic activity in the trabecular region below the femoral head of the femur showed an increase in osteoclast numbers in the bone surface of the growth plate of flight samples compared to ground controls. The number of TRAP-positive osteocytes in cortical bone was increased in response to spaceflight.

Analysis of key mitogenic signal transduction pathways revealed alterations in gene expression of the MAPK pathway."", ""Several genes associated with cell cycle regulation were also altered in flight samples. RT-PCR analysis revealed significant alterations in many cell cycle molecules including a 3.31 fold up-regulation of p21 and down- regulation of p53. Immunohistochemical analysis localized this overexpression of p 21 to osteoblasts along the periosteal surface of the proximal femur."", ""Muscle fibers surrounding the femur contained strongly positive p21 staining nuclei in spaceflight but not ground control samples. No significant staining was found in most sections from both flight and ground controls’, indicating that p53 was not strongly expressed. No statistically significant alterations in Pi3K subunits were noted except a small change in the alpha polypeptide of the catalytic subunit ofPi3K."", ""After exposure to microgravity, the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα, exhibited a significant increase in expression. Several downstream effectors of these signaling pathways were also altered in response to spaceflight, including Rps6kb1 and Eif4ebp1. Analysis of NFκB transcriptional target genes involved in cell adhesion, regulation of apoptosis and growth factors were found to be down-regulated."", ""Osteoclastic activity, osteogenic cell cycle arrest and increased osteocytic osteolysis may also contribute to bone loss in space. We first characterized standard bone mineral and structural parameters following spaceflight to establish the magnitude of bone loss. Our results confirm the ischium portion of the pelvis lost 6.3% bone volume fraction and 11.9% in bone thickness."", ""The geometry of the ischium in flight samples is also altered with a wider marrow cavity conformation than ground controls. The quadratus femoris plays an important “antigravity” role in maintaining a neutral hind-limb posture and can atrophy in microgravity. Osteocytes are the most abundant cell type in bone and are thought to play a role in spaceflight-induced bone loss."", ""The number of TRAP-positive osteocytes in flight samples was increased compared to ground controls, with no apparent differences in cell death or lacunar emptying.

In contrast to these findings we determined that mRNA expression levels of p53 in marrow free bone tissue was down-regulated."", ""In contrast to p53, expression of CDKN1a/p21, a cell cycle arrest mediator, was up-regulated during spaceflight. This may cause an inhibition of osteogenesis and bone formation. MRL mice, which regenerate cartilage, skin, hair follicles, and myocardium with high fidelity, also lack p21 expression."", ""Elevated levels of ROS can result in increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of antioxidants. Various other genes associated with cell cycle regulation were altered in response to spaceflight. The expression of these genes without increased cellular indications of apoptosis could be related to the survival-promoting function of p21 when the cell cycle is arrested."", ""Growth factor binding can have significant impacts on intracellular signaling cascades and gene expression.
